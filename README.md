#idea for codefundo++

- Creating a mobile app to manage the aftermath of natural disasters by providing an interface for the interaction between NGO(s), donors and volunteers.
  
- NGO(s),volunteers and donors have to register themselves on the application giving their contact information(email-id and mobile number) and address. The NGO(s) may be verified physically (if required). The contact details will be verified via OTP.
  The NGO(s) have to update the list of places of calamities they are planning to help along with the number of people affected by the calamity.
  The donors have to choose from a list of items to be donated. The person will select a particular date and time slot of his/her comfort for the NGO(s) to collect the donation items. The details of the donation items and the time slot will be communicated to all the NGO(s) and the NGO that responds back first will be assigned to collect the consignment from the donor. The details of both the parties will be communicated to each other. If a donor wants to provide monetary help then he/she can do so through a secured digital gateway. 
  If an user wants to volunteer he/she shall select the option to work as a volunteer and provide a tentative time period of their availability and the same will be communicated to all the NGO(s) and the NGO that responds back first will be assigned to the volunteer.
Certain guidelines shall be proposed regarding safety of female volunteers such as involvement of atleast one other female member in the disaster relief team.
